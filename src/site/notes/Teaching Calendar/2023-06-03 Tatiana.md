On my way to work
1. The boy brightened up when he saw a pile of gifts under the Christmas tree. 
2. When I feel blue, I cheer myself up by doing some retail therapy.
3. She broke down in tears at the thought of seeing her father after twenty years. 
4. Why are you shouting? Cool down !
5. If you keep bottling up your emotions, youˈll end up needing a therapist.
6. I wasnˈt sure whether I liked this song or not, but then it grew on me.
7. Youˈve got to pull yourself together; itˈs your life only and nobodyˈs going to solve your problems for you.
