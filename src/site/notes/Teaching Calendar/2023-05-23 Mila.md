#Mila 

==The first part of this lesson is based on a UK online forum about noisy family members and neighbours. Sts begin by learning new verbs and verb phrases and talk about noise problems in their families or with their neighbours. Then the present continuous (used for what is happening now or for temporary actions / situations) is presented through conversations between family members and noisy neighbours. Pronunciation focuses on the cc, used in all present continuous endings, and Sts then do a ‘spot the diffeences’ Speaking activity, where they practise the new grammar. The lesson ends with Sts listening to six conversations and guessing what the people are doing.==
