#Mila 

==The main context of this lesson is London – first its weather, and then some unusual tourist attractions. Many Sts who have not visited the UK have the idea that in London it rains a lot, and some even think that it’s still a foggy city. Here they learn the real facts about its climate. Sts begin by learning basic vocabulary to talk about the weather, and listen to a travel guide describing typical London weather. The Grammar (present simple or present continuous) is then presented through some messages between friends in different places around the world. Sts then read an online guide which recommends what to do in London in different seasons. Pronunciation helps Sts pronounce and understand famous place names in London, and the lesson finishes with writing, which deals with how to write posts about your holiday on a social networking site.==
